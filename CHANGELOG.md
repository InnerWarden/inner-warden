# Changelog

All notable changes to InnerWarden are documented here. This project
follows semantic versioning.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-23

First public InnerWarden release: the free, cross-OS guardrail for AI agents. Runs
on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Added

- Command screening: analyzes an AI agent's shell command before it runs and
  returns a verdict (allow, review, or deny).
- Tool-call screening: inspects MCP and tool calls and returns the same verdict.
- MCP proxy: a man-in-the-middle in front of an MCP server that inspects every
  JSON-RPC message and can refuse a disallowed tool call inline, keeping stdout
  pure MCP traffic.
- AI Jail: run an agent in a constrained profile so a screened-and-denied action
  is stopped rather than only flagged.
- Agent discovery: finds AI agents and agent tooling on the machine.
- Local dashboard: a read-only view on loopback at `http://127.0.0.1:8787` that
  never leaves the machine.
- Notifications: surfaces verdicts and events through configured channels.
- Claude Code integration via a PreToolUse hook, plus MCP-client support for
  Cursor, Codex, and other MCP clients.
